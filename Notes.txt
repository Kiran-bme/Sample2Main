Decisions Taken: 

1. Used Selenium - Eclipse 
2. Used TestNG annotations/framework
3. Project with the name "computerDB" is created
4. The base program and the resources are mentioned under the 'src' folder
5. TestCases are under the 'testcases' folder
6. The base.java class contains methods to 'intitialise the driver' and 'getscreenshots'
7. The 'resources' folder contains classes for PageObjects (Create, Edit and Delete) and also a data.properties file
where the Test Data is defined
8. computerDBTestCases.java is the main class that contains 3 Test Cases (Create, Edit and Delete computer)
9. The screenshots of the error/validations messages OR the notifications after Create, Edit and Delete will be 
stored in the C-drive 'test' folder (in your local machine)
10. The Test Case 'editComputer' will cover both Retrieve and Edit operations
11. I have given the priorities (annotations) to the test cases within the computerDBTestCases.java class. 
Create = Priority-1; Edit = priority-2 and Delete = Priority-3
12. Please note all the test cases are designed to execute in Chrome broswer
